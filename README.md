# WordPress-Basic-Theme-Skeleton
This is a repository holding a basic skeleton of a WordPress Theme. Can be easily editable to fit your own needs.


Feel free to fork this and us as you see fit. It currently utilises Bootstrap, however, if you do not need this, this can be taken out of the functions.php.
